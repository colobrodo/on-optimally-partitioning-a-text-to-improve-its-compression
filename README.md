# On Optimally Partitioning a Text to Improve Its Compression

This (Work in progress) presentation covers the optimal text partitioning problem for improving compression efficiency. It should be presented at the [RAVEN Group weekly seminar](https://github.com/raven-laboratory/raven-seminar) at Ca' Foscari University of Venice.

The work outlines the primary technique employed by R. Venturini, I. Nitto and P. Ferragina in their paper ['On Optimally Partitioning a Text to Improve Its Compression'](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-04128-0_38) to approximate dynamic programming algorithms with monotonic edge weight.
