              <p>Sense of direction is a property of labelled networks (i.e., arc-coloured

              processors on the basis of the route followed by incoming messages. We prove
              that (weak) sense of direction is preserved by the construction of regular
              coverings (i.e., coverings induced by voltage assignments in a group) whose
              voltage assignment depends only on colours. Moreover, this construction

               <p>Research on succinct data structures (data structures occupying space close to
               the information-theoretical lower bound, but achieving speed similar to their
               standard counterparts) has steadily increased in the last few years. However,
               many theoretical constructions providing asymptotically optimal bounds are
               unusable in practice because of the very large constants involved. The study
               of practical implementations of the basic building blocks of such data
               structures is thus fundamental to obtain practical applications. In this paper
               we argue that 64-bit and wider architectures are particularly suited to very
               efficient implementations of rank (counting the number of ones up to a given position) 
               and select (finding the position of the <var>i</var>-th bit set), two essential building
               blocks of all succinct data structures. Contrarily to typical 32-bit
               approaches, involving precomputed tables, we use pervasively <em>broadword</em>
               (a.k.a. SWAR&mdash;&ldquo;SIMD in A Register&rdquo;) programming, which compensates the
               constant burden associated to succinct structures by solving problems in parallel
               in a register. We provide an implementation named <code>rank9</code> that addresses
               2<sup>64</sup> bits, consumes less space and is significantly faster then current
               state-of-the-art 32-bit implementations, and a companion <code>select9</code>
               structure that selects in nearly constant time using only access to
               aligned data. For sparsely populated arrays, we provide a simple broadword
               implementation of the Elias&ndash;Fano representation of monotone sequences. In doing
               so, we develop broadword algorithms to perform selection in a word 
               or in a sequence of words that are of independent interest.</p>

              <p>This thesis presents a series of theoretical results and practical
              realisations about the theory of computation in distributive categories.
              Distributive categories have been proposed as a foundational tool for Computer
              Science in the last years, starting from the papers of R.F.C. Walters. We shall
              focus on two major topics: distributive computability, i.e., a generalized
              theory of computability based on distributive categories, and the <b>Imp</b>(<var>G</var>)
              language, which is a language based on the syntax of distributive categories.
              The link between the former and the latter is that the functions computed by
              <b>Imp</b>(<var>G</var>) programs are exactly the distributively computable functions.</p>

              <p>Sense of direction is a property of the labelling of (possibly anonymous) networks
              which allows to assign coherently local identifiers to other processors on the
              basis of the route followed by incoming messages. A graph has <em>minimal
              sense of direction</em> whenever it has sense of direction and the number of 
              colours equals its maximum outdegree. We prove that an outregular
              digraph with minimal <em>weak</em> sense of direction is a Cayley colour graph 
              (in the general sense, i.e., we do not require connectedness). Since Cayley
              colour graphs are known to possess minimal <em>transitive</em> sense of direction, we
              obtain a characterization of outregular graphs with minimal (weak,transitive) sense of
              direction. As a consequence, deciding whether a coloured graph
              is a Cayley colour graph reduces to deciding whether it has weak sense of
              direction, which can be done in AC<sup>1</sup>.</p>

               <p>We prove the existence of a "universal" synchronous self-stabilizing
               protocol, that is, a protocol that allows a distributed system to stabilize to
               a desired nonreactive behaviour (as long as a protocol stabilizing to that
               behaviour exists). Previous proposals required drastic increases in asymmetry
               and knowledge to work, whereas our protocol does not use any additional
               knowledge, and does not require more symmetry-breaking conditions than
               available; thus, it is also stabilizing with respect to dynamic changes in the
               topology. We prove an optimal quiescence time <var>n</var>+<var>D</var> for a synchronous network
               of <var>n</var> processors and diameter <var>D</var>; the protocol can be made finite state with
               a negligible loss in quiescence time. Moreover, an optimal <var>D</var>+1 protocol is
               given for the case of unique identifiers.  As a consequence, we provide an
               effective proof technique that allows to show whether self-stabilization to a
               certain behaviour is possible under a wide range of models.</p>

              <p>A &#x03b4;-uniform BSS machine is a standard BSS machine which does not rely on

              semi-decidable by a BSS machine which is locally time bounded; we also prove

              BSS machines, in particular the existence of decidable sets whose interior
              (closure) is not even semi-decidable without adding constants. Finally, we show
              that the sets semi-decidable by Turing machines are the sets semi-decidable by
              &#x03b4;-uniform machines with coefficients in <b>Q</b> or <b>T</b>, the field

              graphs is essentially as hard as in the general case. In contrast, we show

              Collections are a fundamental tool for reproducible evaluation of
              information retrieval techniques. We describe a new method for distributing
              the document lengths and term counts (a.k.a.&nbsp;within-document frequencies) of a
              web snapshot in a highly compressed and nonetheless quickly accessible form. Our main application is reproducibility
              of the behaviour of focused crawlers: by coupling our collection with the 
              corresponding web graph compressed with <a href="https://webgraph.di.unimi.it/">WebGraph</a> we make it possible
              to apply text-based machine learning tools to the collection, while
              keeping the data set footprint small. Finally, we describe a collection
              based on a crawl of 100Mpages of the <samp>.uk</samp> domain, publicly
              available in bundle with a Java open-source implementation of our techniques.</p>

               <p>It is known that computations of anonymous networks can be reduced to the
               construction of a certain graph, the <em>minimum base</em> of the network. The
               crucial step of this construction is the inference of the minimum base from a
               finite tree that each processor can build (its <em>truncated view</em>). We
               isolate those trees that make this inference possible, and call them
               <em>holographic</em>. Intuitively, a tree is holographic if it is enough
               self-similar to be uniquely extendible to an infinite tree. This possibility
               depends on a <em>size function</em> for the class of graphs under examination,
               which we call a <em>holographic bound</em> for the class. Holographic bounds give
               immediately, for instance, bounds for the quiescence time of self-stabilizing
               protocols. In this paper we give weakly tight holographic bounds for some
               classes of graphs.</p>

                 <p>Weak sense of direction is a property of the labelling of (possibly anonymous)
                 networks that allows one to assign coherently local identifiers to other
                 processors on the basis of the route followed by incoming messages. Though
                 there exists a linear algorithm that allows one to assign a weak sense of
                 direction to any given network, the number of colours used in such construction
                 may be as large as the number of processors. It is an open, difficult, yet
                 intriguing problem that of establishing an <em>optimal</em> weak sense of
                 direction for a given graph, that is, a weak sense of direction using as few
                 colours as possible.  To attack this problem, we have developed an implicit
                 enumeration algorithm that searches for optimal weak sense of direction; the
                 algorithm is implemented in a publicly available tool, <code>optwsod</code>.
                 Although <tt>optwsod</tt> can only deal with graphs that are reasonably small, we think
                 that the results obtained (some examples are presented at the end of the paper)
                 are sometimes surprising and may be used as an inspiration to determine optimal
                 weak sense of direction for classes of graphs. This paper reports some details
                 of the design and implementation of <tt>optwsod</tt>, and some experimental data about
                 its behaviour.</p>

               <p>This paper describes a multirelation semantics for a fragment of the Extended
               Entity-Relationship schemata formalism based on the bicategorical definition of
               multirelations. The approach we follow is elementary&mdash;we try to introduce as
               few notions as possible. We claim that bicategorical algebra handles
               gracefully multirelations and their operations, and that multirelations are
               essential in a number of applications; moreover, the bicategorical composition
               of multirelations turns out to correspond to natural joins. From the formal
               semantics we derive an algorithm that can establish statically the possibility
               of building parallel ownership paths of weak entities. The ideas described in
               this paper have been implemented in a free tool, ERW, which lets users edit
               sets and multirelations instantiating an EER schema <em>via</em> a sophisticated
               web interface.</p>

               cardinality constraints, but, beyond unsatisfiable schemata, this feature may
               create <em>unreachable instances</em>. We prove sound and complete
               characterisations of schemata whose instances satisfy suitable reachability
               properties; these theorems translate into linear algorithms that can be used

              <p>We report our experience in implementing UbiCrawler, a scalable
              distributed web crawler, using the Java programming language.  The
              main features of UbiCrawler are platform independence, linear scalability, graceful degradation
              in the presence of faults, a very effective assignment function (based on
              consistent hashing) for partitioning the
              domain to crawl, and more in general the complete decentralization
              of every task. The necessity of handling very large sets of data has
              highlighted some limitation of the Java APIs, which prompted the

              <p>Deciding which kind of visit accumulates high-quality pages more quickly is
              one of the most often debated issue in the design of web crawlers.  It is
              known that breadth-first visits work well, as they tend to discover pages
              with high PageRank early on in the crawl. Indeed, this visit order is much
              better than depth first, which is in turn even worse than a random
              visit; nevertheless, breadth-first can be superseded using an omniscient
              visit that chooses, at every step, the node of highest PageRank in the
              frontier.</p>
              
              <p>This paper discusses a related, and previously overlooked, measure of
              effectivity for crawl strategies: whether the graph obtained after a partial
              visit is in some sense representative of the underlying web graph as far as
              the computation of PageRank is concerned. More precisely, we are interested
              in determining how rapidly the computation of PageRank over the visited
              subgraph yields relative ranks that agree with the ones the nodes have in the
              complete graph; ranks are compared using Kendall's &tau;.</p>
              
              <p>We describe a number of large-scale experiments that show the following
              paradoxical effect: visits that gather PageRank more quickly (e.g.,
              highest-quality-first) are also those that tend to miscalculate PageRank.
              Finally, we perform the same kind of experimental analysis on some synthetic
              random graphs, generated using well-known web-graph models: the results are
              almost opposite to those obtained on real web graphs.</p>

               PageRank is defined as the stationary state of a Markov chain depending on a
               <em>damping factor</em> &alpha; that spreads uniformly part of the rank. The
               choice of &alpha; is eminently empirical, and in most cases the original
               suggestion &alpha; =  0.85 by Brin and Page is still used. It is common belief
               that values of &alpha; closer to 1 give a &ldquo;truer to the web&rdquo; PageRank,
               but a small &alpha; accelerates convergence. Recently, however, it has been
               shown that when &alpha; = 1 all pages in the core component are very likely to
               have rank 0. This behaviour makes it difficult to understand
               PageRank when &alpha; &#8776; 1, as it converges to a meaningless value for
               most pages. We propose a simple and natural modification to the standard
               preprocessing performed on the adjacency matrix of the graph, resulting in a
               ranking scheme we call <em>TruRank</em>. TruRank ranks the web with principles
               almost identical to PageRank, but it gives meaningful values also when
               &alpha; &#8776; 1.

               PageRank is defined as the stationary state of a Markov chain obtained by
               perturbing the transition matrix of a web graph with a damping factor
               &alpha; that spreads part of the rank. The choice of &alpha; is eminently
               empirical, but most applications use &alpha; = 0.85; nonetheless, the selection
               of &alpha; is critical, and some believe that link farms
               may use this choice adversarially. Recent results prove that
               the PageRank of a page is a rational function of &alpha;, and
               that this
               function can be approximated quite efficiently: this fact can
               be used to define a new form of ranking, TotalRank, that averages
               PageRanks over all possible &alpha;'s. We show how this rank can be computed
               efficiently, and provide
               some preliminary experimental results on its quality and
               comparisons with PageRank.

                 <p>We propose a very simple randomised data structure that stores an approximation

                 a constant number of steps, and the error probability can be balanced with
                 space usage, much like in Bloom filters. The structure is particularly well
                 suited for functions that are bottom on most of their domain. We then show how
                 to use our methods to store in a compact way the bad-character shift function

               <p>Studying web graphs is often difficult due to their large size. Recently,
               several proposals have been published about various techniques that allow to
               store a web graph in memory in a limited space, exploiting the inner
               redundancies of the web. The WebGraph framework is a suite of codes, algorithms
               and tools that aims at making it easy to manipulate large web graphs. This
               papers presents the compression techniques used in WebGraph, which are centred
               around referentiation and intervalisation (which in turn are dual to each
               other). WebGraph can compress the WebBase graph (118 Mnodes, 1 Glinks)
               in as little as 3.08 bits per link, and its transposed version in as little
               as 2.89 bits per link.</p>

                 <p>A fundamental observation about compression of the web graph was made in the

                 lexicographically, ordered successor lists tend to have small gaps, which
                 can be coded using standard methods from full-text index construction. In this
                 paper, we propose &zeta; codes, a family of simple flat codes that are
                 targeted at those gaps, and we give the first thorough mathematical
                 comparative analysis of several codes against power-law
                 distributions with small exponent, which are common for such gaps in web graphs.</p>

              <p>We introduce a new family of simple, complete instantaneous codes for

              integers distributed as a power law with small exponent (smaller than 2).
              The main motivation for the introduction of &zeta; codes comes from
              web-graph compression: if nodes are numbered according to URL lexicographical
              order, gaps in successor lists are distributed according to a power law with
              small exponent. We give estimates of the expected length of &zeta; codes
              against power-law distributions, and compare the results with analogous
              estimates for the more classical &gamma;, &delta; and variable-length block

               behaviour of PageRank with respect to changes in &alpha; was discovered to
               be useful in link-spam detection.  Moreover, an
               analytical justification of the value chosen for &alpha; is still missing.
               In this paper, we give the first mathematical analysis of PageRank when
               &alpha; changes. In particular, we show that, contrarily to popular belief,

               convergence <i>O</i>(<var>t</var><sup><var>k</var></sup> &alpha;<sup><var>t</var></sup>) for the <var>k</var>-th derivative. Finally, we

               the study of PageRank.</p>

              <p>The Java string classes, <code>String</code> and <code>StringBuffer</code>, lie at the extremes of a spectrum
              (immutable, reference-based and mutable, content-based). Analogously,
              available text-search methods on string classes are implemented either as
              trivial, brute-force double loops, or as very sophisticated and
              resource-consuming regular-expression search methods. Motivated by our
              experience in data-intensive text applications, we propose a new string
              class, <code>MutableString</code>, which tries to get the right balance between extremes in both
              cases. Mutable strings can be in one of two states, <em>compact</em> and
              <em>loose</em>, in which they behave more like <code>String</code> and <code>StringBuffer</code>, respectively.
              Moreover, they support a wide range sophisticated text-search algorithms
              with a very low resource usage and setup time, using a new, very simple
              randomised data structure (a generalisation of Bloom filters) that stores an
              approximation from above of a lattice-valued function. Computing the
              function value requires a constant number of steps, and the error
              probability can be balanced with space usage.  As a result, we obtain
              practical implementations of Boyer-Moore type algorithms that can be used
              with very large alphabets, such as Unicode collation elements. The
              techniques we develop are very general and amenable to a wide range of
              applications.</p>

              <p>Large inverted indices are by now common in the construction of web-scale
               search engines. For faster access, inverted indices are indexed internally so that it is
               possible to skip quickly over unnecessary documents. The classical approach
               to skipping dictates that a skip should be positioned every <var>f</var><sup>1/2</sup>
               document pointers, where <var>f</var> is the overall number of documents where the
               term appears. We argue that due to the growing size of the web more refined
               techniques are necessary, and describe how to embed a <em>compressed
               perfect skip list</em> in an inverted list.
               We provide statistical models that explain the empirical distribution of
               the skip data we observe in our experiments, and use them to devise good
               compression techniques that allow us to limit the waste in space,  so that
               the resulting data structure increases the overall index size by just a few
               percents, still making it possible to index pointers with a rather fine
               granularity.</p>

              <p>Minimal-interval semantics associates with each query over a

               antichain):
               witnesses define the minimal regions of the document satisfying the query.
               Minimal-interval semantics makes it easy to define and compute several
               sophisticated proximity
               operators, provides snippets for user presentation, and can be used to rank
               documents: thus, computing efficiently the antichains obtained by operations
               such as logic conjunction and disjunction is a basic issue. In this paper we
               provide the first algorithms for computing such operators that are linear in the
               number of intervals and logarithmic in the number of input antichains. The space
               used is linear in the number of antichains. Moreover, the algorithms are
               <em>lazy</em>&mdash;they do not assume random access to the input antichains.
               These properties make the usage of our algorithms feasible in large-scale web
               search engines.</p>

               <p>This paper studies a family of link-based algorithms that propagate page
               importance through links. In these algorithms there is a damping function
               that decreases with the distance, so a direct link implies more
               endorsement than a link through a long path. PageRank is the most widely known
               ranking function of this family.
               <p>We focus on three damping functions, having linear, exponential, and hyperbolic
               decay on the lengths of the paths. The exponential decay corresponds to
               PageRank, and the other functions are new.  Our analysis includes a comparison
               among them and experiments for studying their behavior under different
               parameters.

              <p>PageRank is a ranking method that assigns scores to web pages using the limit
              distribution of a random walk on the web graph. A <em>fibration</em> of graphs is a
              morphism that is a local isomorphism of in-neighbourhoods, much in the same way
              a covering projection is a local isomorphism of neighbourhoods. We show that a
              deep connection relates fibrations and <em>Markov chains with restart</em>, a
              particular kind of Markov chains that include the PageRank one as a
              special case. This fact provides constraints on the values that PageRank can
              assume. Using our results, we show that a recently defined class of graphs that
              admit a polynomial-time isomorphism algorithm based on the computation of
              PageRank is really a subclass of <em>fibration-prime</em> graphs, which possess
              simple, entirely discrete polynomial-time isomorphism algorithms based on
              classical techniques for graph isomorphism. We discuss efficiency issues in the
              implementation of such algorithms for the particular case of web graphs, in which
              <i>O</i>(<var>n</var>) space occupancy (where <var>n</var> is the number of nodes) may be acceptable, but
              <i>O</i>(<var>m</var>) is not (where <var>m</var> is the number of arcs).

               <p>We discuss a number of issues in the definition, computation and
               comparison of PageRank values that have been addressed sparsely in
               the literature, often with contradictory approaches. We study the
               difference between <em>weakly</em> and <em>strongly</em> preferential
               PageRank, which patch the dangling nodes with different
               distributions, extending analytical formulae known for the strongly
               preferential case, and corroborating our results with experiments on
               a snapshot of 100 millions of pages of the <samp>.uk</samp> domain.  The
               experiments show that the two PageRank versions are poorly
               correlated, and results about each one cannot be blindly applied to
               the other; moreover, our computations highlight some new concerns about the usage of
               exchange-based correlation indices (such as Kendall's &tau;) 
               on approximated rankings.

               <p>Latent semantic analysis is a well-known technique to extrapolate
               concepts from a set of documents; it discards noise by reducing the rank of
               (a variant of) the term/document matrix of a document collection by singular
               value decomposition. The latter is performed by solving an equivalent symmetric
               eigenvector problem on a related matrix.
               Scaling to large set of documents, however, is problematic
               because every vector-matrix multiplication required by iterative solvers
               requires a number of multiplications equal to twice the number of
               postings of the collection.
               We show how to combine standard search-engine algorithmic tools in such a way to
               compute (reasonably)  quickly the cooccurrence matrix <var>C</var> of a large document
               collection, and solve directly the associated symmetric eigenvector problem.
               Albeit the size of <var>C</var> is quadratic in the number of terms, we can distribute
               its computation among any number of computational unit without increasing the
               overall number of multiplications. Moreover, 
               our approach  is advantageous when the document collection is large, because the
               number of terms over which latent semantic analysis has to be performed is
               inherently limited by the size of a language lexicon. We present experiments
               over a collection with 3.6 billions of postings&mdash;two
               orders of magnitudes larger than any published experiment in the literature.

               <p>Query logs record the queries and the actions of the users of search
               engines, and as such they contain valuable information about the
               interests, the preferences, and the behavior of the users, as well as
               their implicit feedback to search-engine results.
               Mining the wealth of information available in the query logs has many
               important applications including query-log analysis, user profiling
               and personalization, advertising, query recommendation, and more.
               
               <p>In this paper we introduce the <em>query-flow graph</em>, a graph
               representation of the interesting knowledge about latent querying
               behavior.
               Intuitively, in the query-flow graph a directed edge from query <var>q<sub>i</sub></var>
               to query <var>q<sub>j</sub></var> means that the two queries are likely to be part
               of the same &ldquo;search mission&rdquo;.
               Any path over the query-flow graph may be seen as a searching
               behavior, whose likelihood is given by the strength of the edges along
               the path.
               
               <p>The query-flow graph is an outcome of query-log mining and, at the same
               time, a useful tool for it.
               We propose a methodology that builds such a graph by mining time and
               textual information as well as aggregating queries from different
               users.
               Using this approach we build a real-world query-flow graph
               from a large-scale query log and we demonstrate its utility in
               concrete applications, namely, <em>finding logical sessions</em>,
               and <em>query recommendation</em>. We believe, however, that the usefulness of
               the query-flow graph goes beyond these two applications.

               <p>A minimal perfect hash function maps a set <var>S</var> of <var>n</var> keys into the
               set {0,1,&hellip;, <var>n</var> &minus; 1} bijectively. Classical results state
               that minimal perfect hashing is possible in constant time using
               a structure occupying space close to the lower bound of 
               log <i>e</i> bits per element. Here we consider the problem of <em>monotone</em>
               minimal perfect hashing, in which the bijection is required to preserve
               the lexicographical ordering of the keys. A monotone minimal perfect
               hash function can be seen as a very weak form of <em>index</em> that provides
               <em>ranking</em> just on the set <var>S</var> (and answers randomly outside of <var>S</var>).
               Our goal is to minimise the description size of the hash function: we show
               that, for a set <var>S</var> of <var>n</var> elements out of a universe of 2<sup><var>w</var></sup> elements, 
               <i>O</i>(<var>n</var> log log <var>w</var>) bits are sufficient to hash monotonically with evaluation time <i>O</i>(log <var>w</var>).
               Alternatively, we can get space <i>O</i>(<var>n</var> log <var>w</var>) bits with <i>O</i>(1) query
               time. Both of these data structures improve a straightforward construction with
               <i>O</i>(<var>n</var> log <var>w</var>) space and <i>O</i>(log <var>w</var>) query time. As a consequence, it is possible
               to search a sorted table with <i>O</i>(1) accesses to the table (using
               additional <i>O</i>(<var>n</var> log log <var>w</var>) bits). Our results are based
               on a structure (of independent interest) that represents a trie in a very
               compact way, but admits errors. As
               a further application of the same structure, we show how to compute
               the predecessor (in the sorted order of <var>S</var>) of an arbitrary element, using <i>O</i>(1)
               accesses in expectation and an index of <i>O</i>(<var>n</var> log <var>w</var>) bits, improving
               the trivial result of <i>O</i>(<var>nw</var>) bits. This implies an efficient index
               for searching a blocked memory.

               a number of tests that show that the graph is actually reliable, and
               provide the first public data on the evolution of the Web that use a large

               <p>Since the first investigations on web graph compression, it has been clear that
               the ordering of the nodes of the graph has a fundamental influence on the
               compression rate (usually expressed as the number of bits per link). The
               authors of the LINK database, for instance, investigated three
               different approaches: an <em>extrinsic</em> ordering (URL ordering) and
               two <em>intrinsic</em> (or <em>coordinate-free</em>) orderings based
               on the rows of the adjacency matrix (lexicographic and Gray code); they
               concluded that URL ordering has many advantages in spite of a small penalty in compression. 
               In this paper we approach this issue in a more systematic way, testing some old
               orderings and proposing some new ones. Our experiments are made in the WebGraph framework, and show that the compression
               technique and the structure of the graph can produce significantly different
               results. In particular, we show that for the <em>transpose</em> web graph URL
               ordering is significantly less effective, and that some new orderings combining
               host information and Gray/lexicographic orderings outperform all previous
               methods. In particular, in some large transposed graphs they yield
               the quite incredible compression rate of 1 bit per link.</p>

               <p>A voting system is a set of rules that a community adopts to take
               collective decisions. In this paper we study voting systems for a
               particular kind of community: electronically mediated
               social networks. In particular, we focus on <em>delegative
               democracy</em> (a.k.a.&nbsp;proxy voting) that has recently received
               increased interest for its ability to combine the benefits of
               direct and representative systems, and that seems also perfectly
               suited for electronically mediated social networks. In such a
               context, we consider a voting system in which users can only
               express their preference for one among the people they are
               explicitly connected with, and this preference can be propagated
               transitively, using an attenuation factor.
               
               <p>We present this system and we study its properties. We also take
               into consideration the problem of missing votes, which is
               particularly relevant in online networks, as some
               recent case shows. Our experiments on real-world networks provide
               interesting insight into the significance and stability of the
               results obtained with the suggested voting system.</p>

              <p>We sketch the history of <em>spectral ranking</em>&mdash;a general umbrella name for
              techniques that apply the theory of linear maps (in particular,
              eigenvalues and eigenvectors) to matrices that do not represent geometric
              transformations, but rather some kind of <em>relationship between entities</em>.
              Albeit recently made famous by the ample press coverage of Google's
              PageRank algorithm, spectral ranking was devised more than a century ago,
              and has been studied in psychology,
              social sciences, bibliometrics, economy, and choice theory. We describe
              the contribution given by previous scholars in precise and modern
              mathematical terms: Along the way, we show how to express in a general way
              <em>damped</em> rankings, such as Katz's index, as dominant eigenvectors of
              perturbed matrices, and then use results on the Drazin inverse to go back
              to the dominant eigenvectors by a limit process. The result suggests a
              regularized definition of spectral ranking that yields for a general
              matrix a unique vector depending on a boundary condition.

               <p>Understanding query reformulation patterns is a key step towards
               next generation web search engines: it can help improving users'
               web-search experience by predicting their intent, and thus helping
               them to locate information more effectively.
               
               <p>As a step in this direction, we build an accurate model for classifying user query reformulations into
               broad classes (generalization, specialization, error correction or
               parallel move), achieving 92% accuracy. We apply the model to
               automatically label two large query logs, creating annotated query-flow graphs. We study the resulting
               reformulation patterns, finding results consistent with previous
               studies done on smaller manually annotated datasets, and discovering new
               interesting patterns, including connections between reformulation
               types and topical categories.
               
               <p>Finally, applying our findings to a third query log that is
               publicly available for research purposes, we demonstrate that our reformulation classifier leads to improved recommendations in a query recommendation system.</p>

               <p>In this paper we study the problem of local triangle counting in large graphs. Namely, given a large graph <var>G</var> = (<var>V</var>, <var>E</var>) we want to estimate as accurately as possible the number of triangles incident to every 
               node <var>v</var> of <var>V</var> in the graph. We consider the question both for undirected and directed graphs. The problem of computing the global number of triangles in a graph has been considered before, but to our knowledge 
               this is the first contribution that addresses the problem of local triangle counting with a focus on the efficiency issues arising in massive graphs and that also considers the directed case. The distribution 
               of the local number of triangles and the related local clustering coefficient can be used in many interesting applications. For example, we show that the measures we compute can help to detect the presence of 
               spamming activity in large-scale Web graphs, as well as to provide useful features for content quality assessment in social networks. For computing the local number of triangles (undirected and directed) we 
               propose two approximation algorithms, which are based on the idea of min-wise independent permutations (Broder et al. 1998). Our algorithms operate in a semi-streaming fashion, using <i>O</i>(|<var>V</var>|) space in main memory and 
               performing <i>O</i>(log |<var>V</var>|) sequential scans over the edges of the graph. The first algorithm we describe in this paper also uses <i>O</i>(|<var>E</var>|)
               space in external memory during computation, while the second algorithm uses only main memory. We present the theoretical analysis as well as experimental results in large graphs, demonstrating the 
               practical efficiency of our approach.</p>

                          <p>This paper introduces a family of link-based ranking algorithms that propagate page importance through links. The algorithms include a damping function which decreases with distance, thus a direct link implies 
                          greater endorsement that a link via a longer path. PageRank is the most widely known ranking function of this family. The main objective of this paper is to determine whether this family of ranking techniques is 
                          of some interest per se, and how different choices for the damping function affect rank quality and convergence speed. Even though our results suggest that PageRank can be approximated with other more simple 
                          forms of rankings that may be computed more efficiently, our focus is more speculative in nature, given that it aims at separating the kernel of PageRank, that is, link-based importance propagation, from the way 
                          propagation decays over paths. We focus on three damping functions that have linear, exponential, and hyperbolic decay on the lengths of the paths. The exponential decay corresponds to PageRank, and the other 
                          functions are new. The work we carry includes algorithms, analysis, comparisons and experiments that study their behavior under different parameters in real Web graph data. 
                          Amongst other results, we show how to calculate a linear approximation that induces a page ordering that is almost identical to PageRank using a fixed number of iterations.

              <p>Since the first investigations on web graph compression, it has been clear that
              the ordering of the nodes of the graph has a fundamental influence on the
              compression rate (usually expressed as the number of bits per link). The
              authors of the LINK database, for instance, investigated three
              different approaches: an <em>extrinsic</em> ordering (URL ordering) and
              two <em>intrinsic</em> (or <em>coordinate-free</em>) orderings based
              on the rows of the adjacency matrix (lexicographic and Gray code); they
              concluded that URL ordering has many advantages in spite of a small penalty in compression. 
              In this paper we approach this issue in a more systematic way, testing some old
              orderings and proposing some new ones. Our experiments are made in the WebGraph framework, 
              and show that the compression
              technique and the structure of the graph can produce significantly different
              results. In particular, we show that for the <em>transpose</em> web graph URL
              ordering is significantly less effective, and that some new orderings combining
              host information and Gray/lexicographic orderings outperform all previous
              methods. In particular, in some large transposed graphs they yield
              the quite incredible compression rate of 1 bit per link.</p>

               <p>We describe a dynamic version of the <em>z-fast trie</em>, a
               new data structure inspired by the research started by the van Emde Boas
               trees and followed by the development of y-fast tries. The dynamic z-fast trie is a very
               simple, uniform data structure: given a set <var>S</var> of <var>n</var> variable-length strings, it is
               formed by a standard compacted trie on <var>S</var>
               (with two additional pointers per node), endowed with a dictionary of
               size <var>n</var>&minus;1. With this simple setup, the dynamic z-fast trie provides
               predecessors/successors in time
               <i>O</i>(log max{&nbsp;|<var>x</var>|, |<var>x</var><sup>+</sup>|, |<var>x</var><sup>-</sup>|&nbsp;}) (<var>x</var><sup>&plusmn;</sup> is the
               successor/predecessor of <var>x</var> in <var>S</var>) for strings of length linear in the
               machine-word size <var>w</var>. Prefix queries are answered in time <i>O</i>(log|<var>x</var>|+<var>k</var>), and range queries in time
               <i>O</i>(log max{&nbsp;|<var>x</var>|, |y|, |<var>x</var><sup>-</sup>|, |<var>y</var><sup>+</sup>|&nbsp;}+<var>k</var>), where <var>k</var> is the number of elements
               in the output and  <var>x</var> (and <var>y</var>) represent the input of the
               prefix (range) queries. Updates are performed within the
               same bounds in expectation (or with high probability using an appropriate
               dictionary). We then show a simple modification that makes it
               possible to handle strings of length up to 2<sup><var>w</var></sup>; in this case, predecessor/successor queries
               and updates are supported in <i>O</i>(|<var>x</var>|/w + log max{&nbsp;|<var>x</var>|, |<var>x</var><sup>+</sup>|, |<var>x</var><sup>-</sup>|&nbsp;}) time, 
               (and <i>O</i>(|<var>x</var>|/<var>B</var> + log max{&nbsp;|<var>x</var>|, |<var>x</var><sup>+</sup>|, |<var>x</var><sup>-</sup>|&nbsp;}) I/Os in the cache-oblivious
               model) with high probability. The space occupied
               by a dynamic z-fast trie, beside that necessary to store <var>S</var>, is just of 12<var>n</var>
               pointers, <var>n</var> integers and, in the ``long string'' case, <i>O</i>(<var>n</var>) signatures of
               <i>O</i>(<var>w</var>) bits each.</p>

               <p>A <em>prefix search</em> returns the strings out of a given collection <var>S</var> that
               start with a given prefix. Traditionally, prefix search is solved by data structures
               that are also dictionaries, that is, they actually contain the strings in
               <var>S</var>. For very large collections stored in slow-access memory, we propose extremely
               compact data structures that solve <em>weak</em> prefix searches&mdash;they return
               the correct result only if <em>some</em> string in  <var>S</var> starts with the given
               prefix. Our data structures for weak prefix search use <i>O</i>(|<var>S</var>&nbsp;|log &#x2113;) bits in 
               the worst case, where &#x2113; is the average string length, as opposed to <i>O</i>(|<var>S</var>|&nbsp;&#x2113;) bits for a dictionary. 
               We show a lower bound implying that this space usage is optimal.

               <p>We continue the line of research on graph compression
               started with WebGraph, but we move our focus to the compression of
               <em>social networks</em> in a proper sense (e.g., LiveJournal):
               the approaches that have been used for a long time to compress web graphs
               rely on a <em>specific</em> ordering of the nodes (lexicographical
               URL ordering) whose extension to general social networks is not trivial. In this
               paper, we propose a solution that mixes clusterings and orders, 
               and devise a new algorithm, called <em>Layered Label Propagation</em>, that builds
               on previous work on scalable clustering and can be used to reorder very large
               graphs (billions of nodes). Our implementation uses <em>decomposition</em> to
               perform aggressively on multi-core architecture, making it possible to reorder
               graphs of more than 600 millions nodes in a few hours.
               Experiments performed on a wide array of web graphs
               and social networks show that combining the order produced by the proposed
               algorithm with the WebGraph compression framework provides a major
               increase in compression with respect to all currently known techniques, 
               <em>both</em> on web graphs <em>and</em> on social networks.
               These improvements make it possible to analyse in main memory significantly
               larger graphs.</p>

               <p>The <em>neighbourhood function</em> <var>N</var><sub><var>G</var></sub>(<var>t</var>) of a graph <var>G</var> gives, for each
               <var>t</var>, the number of pairs of nodes &lt;<var>x</var>,&nbsp;<var>y</var>> such that
               <var>y</var> is reachable from <var>x</var> in less that <var>t</var> hops. The neighbourhood function
               provides a wealth of information about the graph (e.g., it easily
               allows one to compute its diameter), but it is
               very expensive to compute it exactly. Recently, the ANF
               algorithm (approximate neighbourhood function) has been
               proposed with the purpose of approximating <var>N</var><sub><var>G</var></sub>(<var>t</var>) on large graphs. We
               describe a breakthrough improvement over ANF in terms of
               speed and scalability. Our algorithm, called HyperANF, uses the new HyperLogLog
               counters and combines them efficiently through <em>broadword
               programming</em>; our implementation uses
               <em>decomposition</em> to exploit multi-core
               parallelism. With HyperANF, for the first time we can compute in a few hours
               the neighbourhood function of graphs with billions of nodes with a small error and good confidence using a
               standard workstation. 
               
               Then, we turn to the study of the distribution of
               the <em>distances</em> between reachable nodes (that can be efficiently
               approximated by means of HyperANF), and discover the surprising fact that its
               <em>index of dispersion</em> provides a clear-cut characterisation of proper social networks vs.~web graphs. We thus propose the <em>spid</em>
               (Shortest-Paths Index of Dispersion) of a graph as a new, informative statistics
               that is able to discriminate between the above two types of
               graphs. We believe this is the first proposal of a significant
               new non-local structural index for complex networks whose computation is
               highly scalable.

               <p>The <a href="#BBCQFG">query-flow graph</a> is an aggregated
               representation of the latent querying behavior contained in a
               query log. Intuitively, in the query-flow graph a directed edge
               from query <var>q<sub>i</sub></var> to query <var>q<sub>j</sub></var> means that the two queries are
               likely to be part of the same search mission. Any path over
               the query-flow graph may be seen as a possible search task, whose
               likelihood is given by the strength of the edges along the path.
               An edge (<var>q<sub>i</sub></var>,&nbsp;<var>q<sub>j</sub></var>) is also labelled with some information:
               e.g., the probability that user moves from <var>q<sub>i</sub></var> to <var>q<sub>j</sub></var>, or the
               type of the transition, for instance, the fact that <var>q<sub>j</sub></var> is a
               specialization of <var>q<sub>i</sub></var>.
               
               <p>In this paper we propose, and experimentally study, query
               recommendations based on short random walks on the query-flow
               graph. Our experiments show that these methods can match in
               precision, and often improve, recommendations based on query-click graphs,
               without using users' clicks. Our experiments also show that it is important to
               consider transition-type labels on edges for having good quality
               recommendations.
               
               <p>Finally, one feature that we had in mind while devising our
               methods was that of providing diverse sets of recommendations: the
               experimentation that we conducted provides encouraging results in
               this sense.

               <p>
               Understanding query reformulation patterns is a key task towards next
               generation web search engines. If we can do that, then we can build
               systems able to understand and possibly predict user intent, providing the
               needed assistance at the right time, and thus helping users locate
               information more effectively and improving their web-search experience. As
               a step in this direction, we build a very accurate model for classifying
               user query reformulations into broad classes (generalization,
               specialization, error correction or parallel move), achieving 92%
               accuracy. We then apply the model to automatically label two very large
               query logs sampled from different geographic areas, and containing a total
               of approximately 17 million query reformulations. We study the resulting
               reformulation patterns, matching some results from previous studies
               performed on smaller manually annotated datasets, and discovering new
               interesting reformulation patterns, including connections between
               reformulation types and topical categories. We annotate two large
               query-flow graphs with reformulation type information, and run several
               graph-characterization experiments on these graphs, extracting new
               insights about the relationships between the different query reformulation
               types. Finally we study query recommendations based on short random walks
               on the query-flow graphs. Our experiments show that these methods can
               match in precision, and often improve, recommendations based on
               query-click graphs, without the need of users' clicks. Our experiments
               also show that it is important to consider transition-type labels on edges
               for having recommendations of good quality.</p>

               Triple stores have long provided RDF storage as well as data
               access using expressive, formal query languages such as SPARQL. The new
               end users of the Semantic Web, however, are mostly unaware of SPARQL and
               overwhelmingly prefer imprecise, informal keyword queries for searching
               over data. At the same time, the amount of data on the Semantic Web is
               approaching the limits of the architectures that provide support for the
               full expressivity of SPARQL. These factors combined have led to an
               increased interest in semantic search, i.e., access to RDF data using
               Information Retrieval methods. In this work, we propose a method for
               effective and efficient entity search over RDF data. We describe an
               adaptation of the BM25F ranking function for RDF data, and demonstrate
               that it outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in ranking RDF
               resources. We also propose a set of new index structures for efficient
               retrieval and ranking of results. We implement these results using the
               open-source MG4J framework.

               <p>Frigyes Karinthy, in his 1929 short story &ldquo;L&aacute;ancszemek&rdquo; (&ldquo;Chains&rdquo;) suggested
               that any two persons are distanced by at most six friendship
               links. (The exact wording of the story is slightly ambiguous: &ldquo;He bet
               us that, using no more than five individuals, one of whom is a personal
               acquaintance, he could contact the selected individual [&hellip;]&rdquo;. It is not
               completely clear whether the selected individual is part of the five, so this
               could actually allude to distance five or six in the language of graph
               theory, but the &ldquo;six degrees of separation&rdquo; phrase stuck after John Guare's
               1990 eponymous play. Following Milgram's definition and Guare's interpretation, 
               we will assume that &ldquo;degrees of separation&rdquo; is the same as &ldquo;distance
               minus one&rdquo;, where &ldquo;distance&rdquo; is the usual path length&mdash;the number of arcs
               in the path.) Stanley Milgram in his famous experiment
               challenged people to route postcards to a fixed recipient by passing them only 
               through direct acquaintances. The average number of intermediaries
               on the path of the postcards lay between 4.4 and 5.7,
               depending on the sample of people chosen.</p>
               
               <p>We report the results of the first world-scale social-network graph-distance
               computations, using the entire Facebook network of active users (&asymp;721
               million users, &asymp;69 billion friendship links). The average distance we
               observe is 4.74, corresponding to 3.74 intermediaries or &ldquo;degrees
               of separation&rdquo;, showing that the
               world is even smaller than we expected, and prompting the title of this paper.
               More generally, we study the distance distribution of Facebook and of some
               interesting geographic subgraphs, looking also at their evolution over time.</p>
               
               <p>The networks we are able to explore are almost two orders of magnitude larger
               than those analysed in the previous literature. We report detailed statistical
               metadata showing that our measurements (which rely on probabilistic
               algorithms) are very accurate.

                  <p>We recently measured the average distance of users in the Facebook graph,

                  press (&ldquo;<a href="#BBRFDS">Four Degrees of Separation</a>&rdquo;).
                  A number of interesting criticisms have been made about the meaningfulness,
                  methods and consequences of the experiment we performed. In this paper
                  we want to discuss some methodological aspects that we deem important to underline in the form of
                  answers to the questions we have read in newspapers, magazines, blogs, or heard
                  from colleagues.
                  We indulge in some reflections on the
                  actual meaning of &ldquo;average distance&rdquo; and make a number of side observations
                  showing that, yes, 3.74 &ldquo;degrees of separation&rdquo; are really
                  few.

               <p>Compressed inverted indices in use today are based on the idea of gap
               compression: documents pointers are stored in increasing order, and the
               gaps between successive document pointers are stored using suitable codes
               which represent smaller gaps using less bits. Additional data such as
               counts and positions is stored using similar techniques. A large body of
               research has been built in the last 30 years around gap compression,
               including theoretical modeling of the gap distribution, specialized
               instantaneous codes suitable for gap encoding, and <i>ad hoc</i> document
               reorderings which increase the efficiency of instantaneous codes. This paper proposes to represent an
               index using a different architecture based on quasi-succinct
               representation of monotone sequences. We show that, besides being
               theoretically elegant and simple, the new index provides expected
               constant-time operations, space savings, and, in practice, significant
               performance improvements on conjunctive, phrasal and proximity queries.</p>

              <p>Given a social network, which of its nodes are more central? This question 
              has been asked many times in sociology, psychology and computer science, and a
              whole plethora of <em>centrality measures</em> (a.k.a. <em>centrality indices</em>, or <em>rankings</em>) were proposed to account for
              the importance of the nodes of a network. In this paper, we try to provide a 
              mathematically sound survey of the most important classic centrality measures
              known from the literature and propose an <em>axiomatic</em> approach 
              to establish whether they are actually doing what they have been
              designed for. Our axioms suggest
              some simple, basic properties that a centrality measure should exhibit.</p>
              
              <p>Surprisingly, only a new simple measure based on distances,
              <em>harmonic centrality</em>, turns out to satisfy all axioms; essentially, harmonic
              centrality is a correction to Bavelas's classic <em>closeness
              centrality</em> designed to take unreachable nodes into account in a natural way.</p>
              
              <p>As a sanity check, we examine in turn each measure under the lens of information
              retrieval, leveraging state-of-the-art knowledge in the discipline to measure
              the effectiveness of the various indices in locating web pages that are relevant
              to a query. While there are some examples of such comparisons in the literature, here
              for the first time we also take into consideration centrality
              measures based on distances, such as closeness, in an information-retrieval
              setting. The results closely match the data we gathered using our axiomatic approach.</p>
              
              <p>Our results suggest that centrality measures based on distances, which in
              the last years have been
              neglected in information retrieval in favor of spectral centrality measures, 
              do provide high-quality signals; moreover, harmonic centrality
              pops up as an excellent general-purpose centrality index for arbitrary directed graphs.</p>

               <p>Given a social network, which of its nodes are more central? This question 
               has been asked many times in sociology, psychology and computer science, and a
               whole plethora of <em>centrality measures</em> (a.k.a. <em>centrality indices</em>, or <em>rankings</em>) were proposed to account for
               the importance of the nodes of a network.
               In this paper, we approach the problem of computing <em>geometric centralities</em>,
               such as <em>closeness</em> and <em>harmonic centrality</em>, on
               very large graphs; traditionally this task requires an all-pairs shortest-path computation in the exact case, 
               or a number of breadth-first traversals
               for approximated computations, but these techniques yield very weak statistical
               guarantees on highly disconnected graphs. We rather assume that the graph is accessed in a <em>semi-streaming</em>
               fashion, that is, that adjacency lists are scanned almost sequentially,
               and that a very small amount of memory (in the order of a dozen bytes) per node is available
               in core memory. We leverage the newly discovered algorithms based on HyperLogLog
               counters, making it possible to approximate a number of
               geometric centralities at a very high speed and with high accuracy. 
               While the application of similar algorithms for the approximation of 
               closeness was attempted in the MapReduce framework, our exploitation
               of HyperLogLog counters reduces exponentially the memory footprint, paving the way
               for in-core processing of networks with a hundred billion nodes using &ldquo;just&rdquo; 2TiB of RAM.
               Moreover, the computations we describe are inherently parallelizable, and scale linearly with
               the number of available cores.

              This note argues that when dot-plotting distributions typically found in papers about web and social networks 
              (degree distributions, component-size distributions, etc.), and more generally distributions that have high 
              variability in their tail, an exponentially binned version should always be plotted, too, 
              and suggests <em>Fibonacci binning</em> as a visually appealing, easy-to-use and practical choice.

               Marsaglia proposed recently <code>xorshift</code> generators as a class of very fast,
               good-quality pseudorandom number generators. Subsequent analysis by 
               Panneton and L'Ecuyer has lowered the expectations raised by Marsaglia's
               paper, showing several weaknesses of such generators, verified experimentally
               using the TestU01 suite. Nonetheless, many of the weaknesses
               of <code>xorshift</code> generators fade away if their result is scrambled by a non-linear
               operation (as originally suggested by Marsaglia). In this paper we explore the space of possible generators obtained 
               by multiplying the result of a <code>xorshift</code> generator by a suitable constant. We
               sample generators at 100 equispaced points of their state space and obtain detailed statistics that lead
               us to choices of parameters that improve on the current ones. 
               We then explore for the first time the space of high-dimensional <code>xorshift</code> generators, following
               another suggestion in Marsaglia's paper, finding choices of parameters providing periods
               of length 2<sup>1024</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1 and 2<sup>4096</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1. The resulting generators are of extremely high
               quality, faster than current similar alternatives, and generate long-period sequences passing
               strong statistical tests using only eight logical operations, one addition and one multiplication by a constant.

              <code>xorshift*</code> generators are a variant of Marsaglia's <code>xorshift</code> generators 
              that eliminate linear artifacts typical of generators based on <b>Z</b>/2<b>Z</b>-linear
              operations using multiplication by a suitable constant. Shortly
              after high-dimensional <code>xorshift*</code> generators were introduced, Saito and
              Matsumoto suggested a different way to eliminate linear artifacts based on addition in
              <b>Z</b>/2<sup>32</sup><b>Z</b>, leading to the <a href="https://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/XSADD/"><code>XSadd</code></a> generator. Starting from the
              observation that the lower bits of <code>XSadd</code> are very weak, as
              its reverse fails systematically several statistical tests, we explore
              variants of <code>XSadd</code> using 64-bit operations, and describe in
              detail <code>xorshift128+</code>, an extremely fast generator that passes
              strong statistical tests using only three shifts, four xors and an addition.

               <p>The computation of a peeling order in a randomly generated hypergraph is
               the most time-consuming step in a number of constructions, such as
               perfect hashing schemes, random <var>r</var>-SAT solvers, error-correcting codes, and
               approximate set encodings. While there exists a straightforward linear
               time algorithm, its poor I/O performance makes it impractical for
               hypergraphs whose size exceeds the available internal memory.</p>
               
               <p>We show how to reduce the computation of a peeling order to a small number
               of sequential scans and sorts, and analyze its I/O complexity in the
               cache-oblivious model. The resulting algorithm requires <i>O</i>(sort(<var>n</var>)) I/Os
               and <i>O</i>(<var>n</var>&nbsp;log&nbsp;<var>n</var>) time to peel a random hypergraph with <var>n</var> edges.</p>
               
               <p>We experimentally evaluate the performance of our implementation of this
               algorithm in a real-world scenario by using the construction of minimal
               perfect hash functions (MPHF) as our test case: our algorithm builds a
               MPHF of 7.6 billion keys in less than 21 hours on a single machine. The
               resulting data structure is both more space-efficient and faster than that
               obtained with the current state-of-the-art MPHF construction for large-scale key sets.

               creating accurate models of its structure.
               In this paper, we describe and analyse a large, publicly accessible crawl of
               the web that was gathered by the Common Crawl Foundation in 2012 and that contains over
               3.5 billion web pages and 128.7 billion links. This crawl makes it possible
               to observe the evolution of the underlying structure of the World Wide Web
               within the last 10 years: we analyse and compare, among other features,
               degree distributions, connectivity,
               average distances, and the structure of weakly/strongly connected components.</p>
               
               <p>Our analysis shows that, as evidenced by previous research,
               some of the features previously observed by Broder <i>et al.</i> are very dependent on artefacts of the
               crawling process, whereas other appear to be more structural. We confirm the
               existence of a giant strongly connected component; we however find, as observed
               by other researchers, very different
               proportions of nodes that can reach or that can be reached from the giant
               component, suggesting that the ``bow-tie structure'' as described by Broder <i>et al.</i>
               is strongly dependent on the crawling process, and to the
               best of our current knowledge is not a structural property of the web.</p>
               
               <p>More importantly, statistical testing and visual inspection of size-rank plots
               show that the distributions of indegree, outdegree and sizes of strongly
               connected components are not power laws, contrarily to what was previously
               reported for much smaller crawls, although they might be heavy tailed.
               We also provide for the first time accurate measurement of distance-based
               features, using recently introduced algorithms that scale to the size of our
               crawl.</p>

              <p>The push algorithm was proposed first by Jeh and Widom in the context of personalized PageRank computations

              In this note we describe the algorithm at a level of generality that make the computation of the spectral ranking
              of any nonnegative matrix possible. Actually, the main contribution of this note is that the description 
              is very simple (almost trivial), and it requires only a few elementary linear-algebra computations. 
              Along the way, we give new precise ways of estimating the convergence of the algorithm, and 
              describe some of the contribution of the existing literature, which again turn out to be immediate when recast in our framework.

               Understanding the correlation between two different scores for the same set of items
               is a common problem in graph analysis and information retrieval. The most commonly used
               statistics that quantifies this correlation is Kendall's &tau; however, the
               standard definition fails to capture that discordances between items with high
               rank are more important than those between items with low rank. Recently,
               a new measure of correlation based on <em>average precision</em> has been 
               proposed to solve this problem, but like many alternative proposals in
               the literature it assumes that there are <em>no ties</em> in the scores. This is a major deficiency
               in a number of contexts, and in particular when comparing centrality scores on
               large graphs, as the obvious baseline, indegree, has a very large number of ties in social networks and web graphs. We propose to
               extend Kendall's definition in a natural way to take into account weights in the
               presence of ties. We prove a number of interesting mathematical properties of
               our generalization and describe
               an <i>O</i>(<var>n</var> log <var>n</var>) algorithm for its computation. We also validate the usefulness
               of our weighted measure of correlation using experimental data on social networks and web graphs.

              <p>Although web crawlers have been around for twenty years by now, there is
              virtually no freely available, open-source crawling software that
              guarantees high throughput, overcomes the limits of single-machine
              systems, and, at the same time, scales linearly with the amount of
              resources available. This article aims at filling this gap, through the
              description of BUbiNG, our next-generation web crawler built upon the
              authors' experience with UbiCrawler and on the last ten years of
              research on the topic. BUbiNG is an open-source Java fully distributed
              crawler; a single BUbiNG agent, using sizeable hardware, can crawl several
              thousand pages per second respecting strict politeness constraints, both
              host- and IP-based. Unlike existing open-source distributed crawlers that
              rely on batch techniques (like MapReduce), BUbiNG job distribution is
              based on modern high-speed protocols to achieve very high throughput.

               <p>Wikipedia is a huge global repository of human knowledge that can be
               leveraged to investigate interwinements between cultures. With this aim,
               we apply methods of Markov chains and Google matrix for the analysis of
               the hyperlink networks of 24 Wikipedia language editions, and rank all
               their articles by PageRank, 2DRank and CheiRank algorithms. Using
               automatic extraction of people names, we obtain the top 100 historical
               figures, for each edition and for each algorithm. We investigate their
               spatial, temporal, and gender distributions in dependence of their
               cultural origins. Our study demonstrates not only the existence of
               skewness with local figures, mainly recognized only in their own cultures,
               but also the existence of global historical figures appearing in a large
               number of editions. By determining the birth time and place of these
               persons, we perform an analysis of the evolution of such figures through
               35 centuries of human history for each language, thus recovering
               interactions and entanglement of cultures over time. We also obtain the
               distributions of historical figures over world countries, highlighting
               geographical aspects of cross-cultural links. Considering historical
               figures who appear in multiple editions as interactions between cultures,
               we construct a network of cultures and identify the most influential
               cultures according to this network.

              <p>Motivated by applications to information retrieval, we study the lattice of antichains
              of finite intervals of a locally finite, totally ordered set. Intervals are ordered by reverse
              inclusion; the order between antichains is induced by the lower set they generate. We
              discuss in general properties of such <em>antichain completions</em>; in particular, their connection
              with Alexandrov completions. We prove the existence of a unique, irredundant
              &and;-representation by &and;-irreducible elements, which makes it possible to write the relative
              pseudo-complement in closed form. We also discuss in details properties of additional
              interesting operators used in information retrieval. Finally, we give a formula for the
              rank of an element and for the height of the lattice.</p>

               <p>The Open-Source IR Reproducibility Challenge brought together
               developers of open-source search engines to provide reproducible baselines
               of their systems in a common environment on Amazon EC2. The product is a
               repository that contains all code necessary to generate competitive ad hoc
               retrieval baselines, such that with a single script, anyone with a copy of
               the collection can reproduce the submitted runs. Our vision is that these
               results would serve as widely accessible points of comparison in future IR
               research. This project represents an ongoing effort, but we describe the
               first phase of the challenge that was organized as part of a workshop at
               SIGIR 2015. We have succeeded modestly so far, achieving our main goals on
               the Gov2 collection with seven open-source search engines. In this paper,
               we describe our methodology, share experimental results, and discuss
               lessons learned as well as next steps.</p>

               <p>Recent advances in random linear systems on finite fields have paved the way
               for the construction of constant-time data structures representing static
               functions and minimal perfect hash functions using less space with respect to
               existing techniques. The main obstruction for any practical application of
               these results is the cubic-time Gaussian elimination required to solve these
               linear systems: despite they can be made very small, the computation is still
               too slow to be feasible.</p>
               
               <p>In this paper we describe in detail a number of heuristics and programming
               techniques to speed up the resolution of these systems by several orders of
               magnitude, making the overall construction competitive with the standard and
               widely used MWHC technique, which is based on hypergraph peeling. In
               particular, we introduce <em>broadword programming</em> techniques for fast
               equation manipulation and a <em>lazy Gaussian elimination</em> algorithm. We
               also describe a number of technical improvements to the data structure which
               further reduce space usage and improve lookup speed.</p>
               
               <p>Our implementation of these techniques yields a minimal perfect hash function
               data structure occupying 2.24 bits per element, compared to 2.68 for
               MWHC-based ones, and a static function data structure which reduces the
               multiplicative overhead from 1.23 to 1.03.</p>

              <p>Knowledge about the general graph structure of the World Wide Web is important for understanding the social mechanisms that govern its growth, for designing ranking methods, for devising better crawling algorithms, and for creating accurate models of its structure. In this paper, we analyze a large web graph. The graph was extracted from a large publicly accessible web crawl that was gathered by the Common Crawl Foundation in 2012. The graph covers over 3:5 billion web pages and 128:7 billion hyperlinks. We analyze and compare, among other features, degree distributions, connectivity, average distances, and the structure of weakly/strongly connected components. We conduct our analysis on three different levels of aggregation: page, host, and pay-level domain (PLD) (one &ldquo;dot level&rdquo; above public suffixes). Our analysis shows that, as evidenced by previous research (Serrano et al., 2007), some of the features previously observed by Broder et al., 2000 are very dependent on artifacts of the crawling process, whereas other appear to be more structural. We confirm the existence of a giant strongly connected component; we however find, as observed by other researchers (Donato et al., 2005; Boldi et al., 2002; Baeza-Yates and Poblete, 2003), very different proportions of nodes that can reach or that can be reached from the giant component, suggesting that the &ldquo;bow-tie structure&rdquo; as described by Broder et al. is strongly dependent on the crawling process, and to the best of our current knowledge is not a structural property of the Web. More importantly, statistical testing and visual inspection of size-rank plots show that the distributions of indegree, outdegree and sizes of strongly connected components of the page and host graph are not power laws, contrarily to what was previously reported for much smaller crawls, although they might be heavy tailed. If we aggregate at pay-level domain, however, a power law emerges. We also provide for the first time accurate measurement of distance-based features, using recently introduced algorithms that scale to the size of our crawl (Boldi and Vigna, 2013).</p>

              <p>
              A measure of centrality is <em>rank monotone</em> if after adding an arc <var>x</var>&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;<var>y</var>, all nodes with a score smaller than (or equal to) <var>y</var> have still a score smaller than (or equal to) <var>y</var>. If in
              particular all nodes with a score smaller than
              or equal to <var>y</var> get a score smaller than <var>y</var> (i.e., all ties with <var>y</var> are
              broken in favor of <var>y</var>) the measure is called <em>strictly rank monotone</em>. 
              We prove that harmonic centrality is strictly
              rank monotone, whereas closeness is just rank monotone on strongly connected
              graphs, and that some other measures, including
              betweenness, are not rank monotone at all (sometimes not even on strongly
              connected graphs).
              Among spectral measures, <em>damped</em> scores such as Katz's index and
              PageRank are strictly rank monotone on all graphs, whereas the dominant
              eigenvector is strictly monotone on strongly connected graphs only.

              <p>
              <b>F</b><sub>2</sub>-linear pseudorandom number generators are very popular due to their
              high speed, to the ease with which generators with a sizable state space
              can be created, and to their provable theoretical properties. However,
              they suffer from linear artifacts that show as failures in
              linearity-related statistical tests such as the binary-rank and the
              linear-complexity test. In this article, we give two new contributions.
              First, we introduce two new <b>F</b><sub>2</sub>-linear transformations that have been
              handcrafted to have good statistical properties and at the same time to be
              programmable very efficiently on superscalar processors, or even directly
              in hardware. Then, we describe some <em>scramblers</em>, that is, nonlinear
              functions applied to the state array that reduce or delete the linear
              artifacts, and propose combinations of linear transformations and
              scramblers that give extremely fast pseudorandom number generators of high
              quality. A novelty in our approach is that we use ideas from the theory of
              filtered linear-feedback shift registers to prove some properties of our
              scramblers, rather than relying purely on heuristics. In the end, we
              provide simple, extremely fast generators that use a few hundred bits of
              memory, have provable properties, and pass strong statistical tests.

               <p>
               Recent advances in the compact representation of static functions (with
               constant access time) have made it possible to fully exploit constructions based
               on random linear system.
               Such constructions, albeit theoretically appealing, were
               previously too slow to be usable. In this paper, we extend such techniques
               to the problem of storing <em>compressed</em> static
               functions, in the sense that the space used per key should be close to the
               entropy of the list of values. From a theoretical viewpoint, we are inspired
               by the approach of Hreinsson, Kr&oslash;yer and Pagh.
               Values are
               represented using a near-optimal instantaneous code. Then, a bit array is
               created so that by XOR'ing its content at a fixed number of positions depending on the
               key one obtains the
               value, represented by its associated codeword. In the construction phase,
               every bit of the array is associated with an equation on <b>Z</b>/2<b>Z</b>, and
               solving the associated system provides the desired representation. Thus, we pass from one equation per key (the non-compressed
               case) to one equation per <em>bit</em>: the size of the system is thus
               approximately multiplied by the empirical entropy of the values, making the
               problem much more challenging. We show that by carefully engineering
               the value representation we can obtain a practical data structure. For example, we can
               store a function with geometrically distributed output in just 2.28 bits per
               key, independently of the key set, with a construction time double with respect
               to that of a state-of-the-art non-compressed function, which requires
               &asymp;log&nbsp;log&nbsp;<i>n</i> bits per key, where <i>n</i> is the number of keys, and
               slightly improved lookup time. We can also store a function with
               an output of 10<sup>6</sup> values distributed
               following a power law of exponent 2 in just 2.75 bits per key, whereas a
               non-compressed function would require more than 20, with a threefold increase in construction
               time and significantly faster lookups.

               Once upon a time, a king had a very, very long list of names of his subjects.
               The king was also a bit
               obsessed with name days: every day he would ask his servants to
               look the list for all persons having their name day. Reading every day the whole
               list was taking an enormous amount of time to the king's servants. One day, the chancellor had a
               magnificent idea: he wrote a book with instructions. The number
               of pages in the book was equal to the number of names,
               but following the instructions one could find all people having their name day by
               looking at only a few pages---in fact, as many pages as the length of the
               name---and just glimpsing at the list. Everybody was happy, but in time the
               king's servants got lazy:
               when the name was very long they would find excuses to avoid looking at 
               so many pages, and some name days were skipped. Desperate, the
               king made a call through its reign, and a fat sorceress answered. There was
               a way to look at much, much fewer pages using an additional magic book. But
               sometimes, very rarely, it would not work (magic does not always work). The
               king accepted the offer, and name days parties restarted. Only, once every a few
               thousand years, the magic book fails, and the assistants have to go by the
               chancellor book. So the parties start a bit later. But they start anyway.

               <p>
               A <em>minimal perfect hash function</em> bijectively maps a key set <i>S</i> out of a universe <i>U</i> into
               the first |<i>S</i>| natural numbers. Minimal perfect hash functions are used, for example, to map irregularly-shaped keys,
               such as strings, in a compact space so that metadata can then be simply stored in an array.
               While it is known that just 1.44 bits per key are necessary to store a minimal perfect hash function,
               no published technique can go below 2 bits per key in practice.
               We propose a new technique
               for storing minimal perfect hash functions with expected linear construction time and expected
               constant lookup time that makes it possible to build for the first time, for example, structures which need 1.56
               bits per key, that is, within 8.3% of the lower bound, in less than 2ms per key.
               We show that instances of our construction are able to <em>simultaneously</em> beat the construction time,
               space usage and lookup time of the state-of-the-art data structure reaching 2 bits per key.
               Moreover, we provide parameter choices giving structures
               which are competitive with alternative, larger-size data structures in terms of space and lookup time.
               The construction of our data structures can be easily
               parallelized or mapped on distributed computational units (e.g., within the MapReduce framework),
               and structures larger than the available RAM can be directly built in mass storage.

              <p>
              The Fenwick tree is a classical implicit
              data structure that stores an array in such a way that modifying an element,
              accessing an element, computing a prefix sum and performing a predecessor search
              on prefix sums all take logarithmic time. We introduce a number of variants
              which improve the classical implementation of the tree: in particular, we can
              reduce its size when an upper bound on the array element is known, and we can
              perform much faster predecessor searches. Our aim is to use our variants to
              implement an efficient <em>dynamic bit vector</em>:
              our structure is able to perform updates, ranking and selection in logarithmic
              time, with a space overhead in the order of a few percents, outperforming
              existing data structures with the same purpose. Along the way, we highlight the
              pernicious interplay between the arithmetic behind the Fenwick tree and the
              structure of current CPU caches, suggesting simple solutions that improve
              performance significantly.</p>

              When the Mersenne Twister made his first appearance in 1997 it was a powerful example
              of how linear maps on <b>F</b><sub>2</sub> could be used to generate pseudorandom numbers. In
              particular, the easiness with which generators with long periods could be defined
              gave the Mersenne Twister a large following, in spite of the fact that such long periods
              are not a measure of quality, and they require a large amount of memory. Even
              at the time of its publication, several defects of the Mersenne Twister were predictable,
              but they were somewhat obscured by other interesting properties.
              Today the Mersenne Twister is the default generator in C compilers,
              the Python language, the Maple mathematical computation system, and in many other 
              environments. Nonetheless, knowledge accumulated in the last 20 years suggests that
              the Mersenne Twister has, in fact, severe defects, and should never be used as a general-purpose 
              pseudorandom number generator. Many of these results are folklore, or are scattered through very specialized
              literature. This paper surveys these results for the non-specialist, providing new,
              simple, understandable examples, and it is intended
              as a guide for the final user, or for language implementors, so that they can take
              an informed decision about whether to use the Mersenne Twister or not.

               Since the seminal work of Litvak and van der Hofstad, it has been
               known that Newman's assortativity, being based on Pearson's
               correlation, is subject to a pernicious size effect which makes large
               networks with heavy-tailed degree distributions always unassortative.
               Usage of Spearman's &rho;, or even Kendall's &tau; was suggested as a
               replacement but the treatment of ties was problematic for both
               measures. In this paper we first argue analytically that the tie-aware
               version of &tau; solves the problems observed, and we show that
               Newman's assortativity is heavily influenced by tightly knit communities.
               Then, we perform for the first time a set of large-scale computational
               experiments on a variety of networks, comparing assortativity based on
               Kendall's &tau; and assortativity based on Pearson's correlation, showing
               that the pernicious effect of size is indeed very strong on real-world
               large networks, whereas the tie-aware Kendall's &tau; can be a practical,
               principled alternative.

               We consider the problem of mining the development history&mdash;as captured by
               modern version control systems&mdash;of ultra-large-scale software archives
               (e.g., tens of millions software repositories corresponding).
               
               <p>
               We show that graph compression techniques can be applied to the problem,
               dramatically reducing the hardware resources needed to mine
               similarly-sized corpus. As a concrete use case we compress the full
               Software Heritage archive, consisting of 5 billion unique source code
               files and 1 billion unique commits, harvested from more than 80 million
               software projects&mdash; encompassing a full mirror of GitHub.
               
               <p>
               The resulting compressed graph fits in less than 100GB of RAM,
               corresponding to a hardware cost of less than 300 U.S. dollars. We show
               that the compressed in-memory representation of the full corpus can be
               accessed with excellent performances, with edge lookup times close to
               memory random access. As a sample exploitation experiment we show that the
               compressed graph can be used to conduct clone detection at this scale,
               benefiting from main memory access speed.

               <p>Recent advances in the analysis of random linear systems on finite fields have
               paved the way for the construction of constant-time data structures
               representing static functions and minimal perfect hash functions using less space with respect to existing techniques. The main
               obstacle for any practical application of these results is the
               time required to solve such linear systems:
               despite they can be made very small, the computation is still too slow to be feasible.
               
               In this paper, we describe in detail a number of heuristics and programming
               techniques to speed up the solution of these systems by orders of
               magnitude, making the overall construction competitive with the standard and
               widely used MWHC technique, which is based on hypergraph peeling. In
               particular, we introduce <em>broadword programming</em> techniques for fast
               equation manipulation and a <em>lazy Gaussian elimination</em> algorithm. We
               also describe a number of technical improvements to the data structure which
               further reduce space usage and improve lookup speed.
               
               Our implementation of these techniques yields a minimal perfect hash function
               data structure occupying 2.24 bits per element, compared to 2.68 for
               MWHC-based ones, and a static function data structure which reduces the
               multiplicative overhead from 1.23 to 1.024. For functions whose output
               has low entropy, we are able to implement feasibly for the first time the
               Hreinsson&ndash;Kr&oslash;yer&ndash;Pagh approach, which makes it possible, for example, to
               store a function with an output of 10<sup>6</sup> values distributed following a power
               law of exponent 2 in just 2.76 bits per key instead of 20.

               <p>SciPy is an open-source scientific computing library for the Python
               programming language. Since its initial release in 2001, SciPy has
               become a de facto standard for leveraging scientific algorithms in
               Python, with over 600 unique code contributors, thousands of dependent
               packages, over 100,000 dependent repositories and millions of downloads
               per year. In this work, we provide an overview of the capabilities and

  title    = {{LXM}: Better Splittable Pseudorandom Number Generators (and Almost as Fast)},
  notextra = {
              <p>
              In 2014, Steele, Lea, and Flood presented <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">SplitMix</span>, an object-oriented pseudorandom number generator (<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">prng</span>)
              that is quite fast (9 64-bit arithmetic/logical operations per 64 bits generated) and also splittable. A conventional
              <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">prng</span> object provides a generate method that returns one pseudorandom value and updates the state of the
              <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">prng</span>; a splittable <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">prng</span> object also has a second operation, split, that replaces the original <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">prng</span> object with
              two (seemingly) independent <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">prng</span> objects, by creating and returning a new such object and updating the
              state of the original object. Splittable <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">prng</span> objects make it easy to organize the use of pseudorandom numbers
              in multithreaded programs structured using fork-join parallelism. This overall strategy still appears to be
              sound, but the specific arithmetic calculation used for generate in the <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">SplitMix</span> algorithm has some detectable
              weaknesses, and the period of any one generator is limited to 2<sup>64</sup>.
              <p>Here we present the LXM family of <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">prng</span> algorithms. The idea is an old one: combine the outputs of two
              independent <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">prng</span> algorithms, then (optionally) feed the result to a mixing function. An LXM algorithm uses
              a linear congruential subgenerator and an <b>F</b><sub>2</sub>-linear subgenerator; the examples studied in this paper use a
              linear congruential generator (LCG) of period 2<sup>16</sup>, 2<sup>32</sup>, 2<sup>64</sup>, or 2<sup>128</sup> with one of the multipliers recommended
              by L'Ecuyer or by Steele and Vigna, and an <b>F</b><sub>2</sub>-linear xor-based generator (XBG) of the <code>xoshiro</code> family or
              <code>xoroshiro</code> family as described by Blackman and Vigna. For mixing functions we study the MurmurHash3
              finalizer function; variants by David Stafford, Doug Lea, and degski; and the null (identity) mixing function.
              <p>Like <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">SplitMix</span>, LXM provides both a generate operation and a split operation. Also like <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">SplitMix</span>, LXM
              requires no locking or other synchronization (other than the usual memory fence after instance initialization),
              and is suitable for use with simd instruction sets because it has no branches or loops.
              <p>We analyze the period and equidistribution properties of LXM generators, and present the results of
              thorough testing of specific members of this family, using the TestU01 and PractRand test suites, not only on
              single instances of the algorithm but also for collections of instances, used in parallel, ranging in size from 2 to
              2<sup>24</sup>. Single instances of LXM that include a strong mixing function appear to have no major weaknesses, and
              LXM is significantly more robust than <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">SplitMix</span> against accidental correlation in a multithreaded setting. We
              believe that LXM, like <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">SplitMix</span>, is suitable for &ldquo;everyday&rdquo; scientific and machine-learning applications (but
              not cryptographic applications), especially when concurrent threads or distributed processes are involved.

               We study the problem of <em>score</em> and <em>rank</em> monotonicity for <em>spectral ranking</em> methods,
               such as eigenvector centrality and PageRank, in the case of undirected networks. Score monotonicity means that
               adding an edge increases the score at both ends of the edge. Rank monotonicity means that adding
               an edge improves the relative position of both ends of the edge with respect to the remaining nodes. 
               It is known that common spectral rankings are both score and rank monotone on directed, strongly connected graphs.
               We show that, surprisingly, the
               situation is very different for undirected graphs, and in particular that PageRank is
               neither score nor rank monotone.

              Is it always beneficial to create a new relationship (have a new follower/friend) in a social network? 
              This question can be formally stated as a property of the centrality measure that defines 
              the importance of the actors of the network. <em>Score monotonicity</em> means that adding an arc 
              increases the centrality score of the target of the arc; <em>rank monotonicity</em> means that adding 
              an arc improves the importance of the target of the arc relatively to the remaining nodes. 
              It is known that most centralities are both score and rank monotone on directed, strongly connected graphs. 
              In this paper, we study the problem of score and rank monotonicity for classical centrality 
              measures in the case of <em>undirected</em> networks: in this case, we require that score, or relative 
              importance, improve at both endpoints of the new edge. We show that, surprisingly, the situation
              in the undirected case is very different, and in particular that closeness, harmonic centrality, 
              betweenness, eigenvector centrality, Seeley's index, Katz's index, and PageRank are not rank monotone; 
              betweenness and PageRank are not even score monotone. In other words, while it is always a 
              good thing to get a new follower, it is not always beneficial to get a new friend.

               <p>
               Progress in High-Performance Computing in general, and High-Performance
               Graph Processing in particular, is highly dependent on the availability of
               publicly-accessible, relevant, and realistic data sets. To ensure
               continuation of this progress, we (i) investigate and optimize the process
               of generating large sequence similarity graphs as an HPC challenge and
               (ii) demonstrate this process in creating MS-BioGraphs, a new family of
               publicly available real-world edge-weighted graph datasets with up to 2.5
               trillion edges, that is, 6.6 times greater than the largest graph
               published recently. The largest graph is created by matching (i.e.,
               all-toall similarity aligning) 1.7 billion protein sequences. The
               MSBioGraphs family includes also seven subgraphs with different sizes and

               In the study of the behavior of centrality measures with respect to network modifications, 
               score monotonicity means that adding an arc increases the centrality score of the target of 
               the arc; rank monotonicity means that adding an arc improves the importance of the target 
               of the arc relative to the remaining nodes. It is known that score and rank monotonicity 
               hold in directed graphs for almost all the classical centrality measures. In undirected 
               graphs one expects that the corresponding properties (where both endpoints of the 
               new edge enjoy the increase in score/rank) hold when adding a new edge. However, 
               recent results have shown that in undirected networks this is not true: for many 
               centrality measures, it is possible to find situations where adding an edge reduces 
               the rank of one of its two endpoints. In this paper we introduce a weaker condition 
               for undirected networks, semi-monotonicity, in which just one of the endpoints of a 
               new edge is required to enjoy score or rank monotonicity. We show that this condition 
               is satisfied by closeness and betweenness centrality, and that harmonic centrality satisfies it in an even stronger sense.

               We report the results of a yearlong effort at the
               Laboratory for Web Algorithmics and Inria to port the
               WebGraph framework from Java to Rust. For two decades
               WebGraph has been instrumental in the analysis and
               distribution of large graphs for the research community of
               TheWebConf, but the intrinsic limitations of the Java
               Virtual Machine had become a bottleneck for very large use
               cases, such as the Software Heritage Merkle graph with
               its half a trillion arcs. As part of this clean-slate
               implementation of WebGraph in Rust, we developed a few
               ancillary projects bringing to the Rust ecosystem some
               missing features of independent interest, such as easy,
               consistent and zero-cost memory mapping of data
               structures. WebGraph in Rust offers impressive performance
               improvements over the previous implementation, enabling
               open-source graph analytics on very large datasets like
               Common Crawl, on top of a modern systems programming
               language.

However, a number of serious concerns have been raised recently, questioning whether today's computational work is adequately reproducible.

But in practice, there are fundamental, technical, and social barriers to doing so. The many objectives and meanings of reproducibility are discussed within the context of scientific computing.

  abstract  = {Parallel radix sorting has been extensively studied in the literature for decades. However, the most efficient implementations require auxiliary memory proportional to the input size, which can be prohibitive for large inputs. The standard serial in-place radix sorting algorithm is based on swapping each key to its correct place in the array on each level of recursion. However, it is not straightforward to parallelize this algorithm due to dependencies among the swaps. This paper presents Regions Sort, a new parallel in-place radix sorting algorithm that is efficient both in theory and in practice. Our algorithm uses a graph structure to model dependencies across elements that need to be swapped, and generates independent tasks from this graph that can be executed in parallel. For sorting n integers from a range r, and a parameter K, Regions Sort requires only O(K\l{}og r\l{}og n) auxiliary memory. Our algorithm requires O(n\l{}og r) work and O((n/K+\l{}og K)\l{}og r) span, making it work-efficient and highly parallel. In addition, we present several optimizations that significantly improve the empirical performance of our algorithm. We compare the performance of Regions Sort to existing parallel in-place and out-of-place sorting algorithms on a variety of input distributions and show that Regions Sort is faster than optimized out-of-place radix sorting and comparison sorting algorithms, and is almost always faster than the fastest publicly-available in-place sorting algorithm.},

  abstract   = {We present new sequential and parallel sorting algorithms that now represent the fastest known techniques for a wide range of input sizes, input distributions, data types, and machines. Somewhat surprisingly, part of the speed advantage is due to the additional feature of the algorithms to work in-place, i.e., they do not need a significant amount of space beyond the input array. Previously, the in-place feature often implied performance penalties. Our main algorithmic contribution is a blockwise approach to in-place data distribution that is provably cache-efficient. We also parallelize this approach taking dynamic load balancing and memory locality into account.Our new comparison-based algorithm In-place Parallel Super Scalar Samplesort (IPS4o), combines this technique with branchless decision trees. By taking cases with many equal elements into account and by adapting the distribution degree dynamically, we obtain a highly robust algorithm that outperforms the best previous in-place parallel comparison-based sorting algorithms by almost a factor of three. That algorithm also outperforms the best comparison-based competitors regardless of whether we consider in-place or not in-place, parallel or sequential settings.Another surprising result is that IPS4o even outperforms the best (in-place or not in-place) integer sorting algorithms in a wide range of situations. In many of the remaining cases (often involving near-uniform input distributions, small keys, or a sequential setting), our new In-place Parallel Super Scalar Radix Sort (IPS2Ra) turns out to be the best algorithm.Claims to have the – in some sense – &ldquo;best&rdquo; sorting algorithm can be found in many papers which cannot all be true. Therefore, we base our conclusions on an extensive experimental study involving a large part of the cross product of 21 state-of-the-art sorting codes, 6 data types, 10 input distributions, 4 machines, 4 memory allocation strategies, and input sizes varying over 7 orders of magnitude. This confirms the claims made about the robust performance of our algorithms while revealing major performance problems in many competitors outside the concrete set of measurements reported in the associated publications. This is particularly true for integer sorting algorithms giving one reason to prefer comparison-based algorithms for robust general-purpose sorting.},

              <p>
              We describe a simple and yet very scalable implementation of static functions
              (<span style="font-variant: small-caps">VFunc</span>) and of static filters (<span style="font-variant: small-caps">VFilter</span>) based on hypergraphs. We introduce
              the idea of <em>$\varepsilon$-cost sharding</em>, which allows us to build
              structures that can manage trillions of keys, at the same time increasing
              memory locality in hypergraph-based constructions. Contrarily to the commonly
              used HEM sharding method, $\varepsilon$-cost sharding does not
              require to store of additional information, and does not introduce
              dependencies in the computation chain; its only cost is that of few
              arithmetical instructions, and of a relative increase $\varepsilon$ in space
              usage. We apply $\varepsilon$-cost sharding to the classical MWHC
              construction, but we obtain the best result by combining
              Dietzfelbinger and Walzer's <em>fuse graphs</em> for large
              shards with <em>lazy Gaussian elimination</em> for small shards. We
              obtain large structures with an overhead of 10.5% with respect to the
              information-theoretical lower bound and with a query time that is a few
              nanoseconds away from the query time of the non-sharded version, which is the
              fastest currently available within the same space bounds. Besides comparing
              our structures with a non-sharded version, we contrast its tradeoffs with
              <em>bumped ribbon</em> constructions, a space-saving
              alternative to hypergraph-based static functions and filters, which provide
              optimum space consumption but slow construction and query time (though
              construction can be parallelized very efficiently). We build offline a
              trillion-key filter using commodity hardware in just 60 ns/key.</p>

               <p>Among the properties describing the behavior of centrality measures with respect to network modifications, 
               <em>score monotonicity</em> means that adding an arc increases the centrality score of the target of the arc; 
               <em>rank monotonicity</em> means that adding an arc improves the importance of the target with respect to the remaining nodes. 
               It is known that score and rank monotonicity hold in directed graphs for almost all the classical centrality measures.
               In undirected graphs one expects that the corresponding properties hold when adding a new edge---in this case,
               both endpoints of the new edge should enjoy the increase in score/rank. However, recent results 
               have shown that this is not true: for many centrality measures, it is possible to find situations in which 
               adding an edge reduces the rank of one of its two endpoints. In this paper we introduce a weaker 
               property for undirected networks, <em>semi-monotonicity</em>, in which just one of the two endpoints of a 
               new edge is required to enjoy score or rank monotonicity. We show that this property is 
               satisfied by closeness centrality, by a large class of distance-based centralities, 
               and (somehow surprisingly) by betweenness centrality. In the last two cases, we prove in 
               fact a stronger property, <em>basin dominance</em>, which is of independent interest.</p>

  abstract  = {Centrality indices are ways to measure the importance of nodes in a graph; this need is so obviously relevant that it was discussed many times in sociology, psychology, mathematics and computer science, giving rise to a whole zoo of definitions of centrality. The ideas underlying such definitions are wildly different, but many centrality measures are based on shortest-path distances: such centralities are referred to as geometric. Albeit geometric centralities can use the shortest-path--length information in many different ways, most of the existing geometric centralities can be defined as a linear transformation. In this paper we define formally the class of linear geometric centralities in its full generality, and study its main properties and expressivity.},
