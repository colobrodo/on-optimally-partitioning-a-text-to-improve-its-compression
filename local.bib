abstract="In this paper we investigate the problem of partitioning an input string T in such a way that compressing individually its parts via a base-compressor {\$}{\{}{\backslash}mathcal C{\}}{\$}gets a compressed output that is shorter than applying {\$}{\{}{\backslash}mathcal C{\}}{\$}over the entire T at once. This problem was introduced in [2,3] in the context of table compression, and further elaborated and extended to strings and trees by [10,11,20], but it is still open how to efficiently compute the optimal partition [4]. In this paper we provide the first algorithm which is guaranteed to compute in O(npolylog(n)) time a partition of T whose compressed output is guaranteed to be no more than (1{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}$\epsilon$)-worse the optimal one, where $\epsilon$ is any positive constant.",
